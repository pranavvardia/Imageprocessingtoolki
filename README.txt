Group Number - 13

### Task 1 - IMT2016012 (Yelugoti Mohana Datta)
  Classes used: Task1
  Completed Task1
  Helped in fixing error in CompositeImage.cpp;


### Task 3 - IMT2016066 (Chinmayeesai Vajrala)
  Classes used: GaussianFilter,xAxisReflection
  Completed Task3
  ** Task : Gaussian filter on special reflected image ** : Pixel locations in the minima 8-neighbourhood of the reflected image of the main file are marked. this image is modified to have the 24-neighbourhood of the marked pixels as black and the rest as white. the gaussian filter is applied on the marked locations and the output image is created.


### Task 4 - IMT2016126 (Tanishq Gupta)
  Classes used: Histogram4
  Completed Task4
  Helped in making readme
  ** Task : Brightness based Image Segmentation ** : Segmentation is done by plotting a brightness histogram. The histogram is divided into segments based on local-minims. The first 6 segments of the histogram (corresponding to relatively lower brightness) have the following colours {red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan} the rest of the segments are coloured black.


### Task 5 - IMT2016107 (Shubham Jain)
  Classes used: Histogram4
  Completed Task5

### Task 6 - IMT2016040 (Pranav Vardia)
  Classes used: Histogram,Segmentation
  Completed Task6
  Integrated the code
  Made the readme file
  Made the base classes.


### Task 7 - IMT2016087 (Raja R)
  Classes used: ScaledImage
  Completed Task7
  ** Task : Composition of scaled-reflected image and original image ** : The image is scaled down to 0.5 by width and height and combined 4 times (the scaled down images are reflected on each of the axis) to give a new image. This new image is then clipped by a scaled down stencil.
